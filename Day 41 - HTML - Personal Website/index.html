    <br>
    <p>I am a Data Analyst/Engineer who is passionate about learning and continuous improvement.
        Being adaptable and flexible has enabled me to challenge conventional ways of working and learn new and more
        efficient techniques. People can count on me for my dedication to team building and project accomplishment.
        My positive attitude allows me to bring energy and trust to the team, leading the team to perform at or above
        the standard.<br><br>What is unique about me is my superior capacity of understanding new concepts and applying
        them correctly. I am continuously advancing my programming skills and knowledge in the tech and ICT industry by
        taking various courses. I have a passion for data analysis, and I like to explore the relationships between
        numbers, translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. I am competent in languages such as Python and SQL for
        data analysis and database management. Currently, I am focused on gaining more experience in Power BI, Azure and
        Google Could Services.<br><br>I pride myself on the high-level problem-solving skills that I have used in all
        roles to overcome adversity and guarantee efficiencies in my team. Resilience also enabled me to successfully
        complete an innovative project in 2019, resulting in designing a new setup/methodology and corresponding patent
        application (US Patent App. #16/413,006).<br><br>My passion for learning enables me to thrive in a dynamic work
        environment where I can take on a project and deliver the best results that would derive a business towards
        success. When a complex situation is encountered, I enjoy rearranging the factors to make the most productive
        configuration possible and I try to find the best way to get things done. Over the years, I have worked with
        cross-functional teams on various innovative research projects. My communication and leadership skills have
        enabled me to be successful in all areas, publish more than 15 conference/journal papers and a patent
        application.</p>
