 I have strated a 100 day code challenge and will post a new code everyday for the next 100 days. 
**STAY TUNED...**

## *Day 1*
This is a simple code that asks user to provide informations such as their favorite color and name of their pet to suggest a band name. this code uses simple functions such as print and input, and requires some variable manipulations.

## *Day 2*
Imagine you are out with your friend and you want to split your resturant bill between yourselves. How do you calculate every person's share??

This simple code takes bill total, your desired tip percentage and number of people to calculate how much each person should pay for their share. 
Problem solved! next time you want to split your bill, try using this code.

## *Day 3*
Have you ever read one of the "choose your adventure" books?

Today's code is a simple version of a treasure hunt adventure game. You are asked multiple questions throughout the game, and your answers determine your next steps.

Try to find the treasure!!!

## *Day 4*
This is a code to play the clasic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. you are asked to enter your choice and it is compared to a random computer generated choice to find the winner. Check out the [The World Rock Paper Scissors Association](https://www.wrpsa.com/) to learn more about this game.

## *Day 5*
Do you have problem finding a secure password for your online accounts?

Has any of your accounts been hacked before?

If your answer to any of these questions is "yes", today's code is for you. This program generates a combination of letters and numbers to generate a random password that cannot be guessed by anyone. Next time you want to choose a new password, try this code!
