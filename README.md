# Python-Bootcamp-Codes
 I have strated a 100 day code challenge and will post a new code everyday for the next 100 days. 
**STAY TUNED...**

## *Day 1*
This is a simple code that asks user to provide informations such as their favorite color and name of their pet to suggest a band name. this code uses simple functions such as print and input, and requires some variable manipulations.
