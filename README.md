# Python-Bootcamp-Codes
 I have strated a 100 day code challenge and will post a new code everyday for the next 100 days. 
**STAY TUNED...**

## [*Day 1 - Band Name Generator*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%201%20-%20Band%20Name%20Generator/main.py)
This is a simple code that asks user to provide informations such as their favorite color and name of their pet to suggest a band name. this code uses simple functions such as print and input, and requires some variable manipulations.

## [*Day 2 - Tip Calculator*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%202%20-%20Tip%20Calculator/main.py)
Imagine you are out with your friend and you want to split your resturant bill between yourselves. How do you calculate every person's share??

This simple code takes bill total, your desired tip percentage and number of people, to calculate how much each person should pay for their share. 
Problem solved! next time you want to split your bill, try using this code.

## [*Day 3 - Treasure Hunt Game*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%203%20-%20Treasure%20Hunt%20Game/main.py)
Have you ever read one of the "choose your adventure" books?

Today's code is a simple version of a treasure hunt adventure game. You are asked multiple questions throughout the game, and your answers determine your next steps.

Try to find the treasure!!!

## [*Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%204%20-%20Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Scissors%20Game/main.py)
This is a code to play the clasic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. you are asked to enter your choice and it is compared to a random computer generated choice to find the winner. Check out the [The World Rock Paper Scissors Association](https://www.wrpsa.com/) to learn more about this game.

## [*Day 5 - PyPassword Generator*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%205%20-%20PyPassword%20Generator/main.py)
Do you have problem finding a secure password for your online accounts?

Have any of your accounts been hacked before?

If your answer to any of these questions is "yes", today's code is for you. This program generates a combination of letters and numbers to generate a random password that cannot be guessed by anyone. Next time you want to choose a new password, try this code!

## [*Day 6 - Escaping the Maze Game*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%206%20-%20Escaping%20the%20Maze%20Game/main.py)
Today's code is to solve a maze in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json). The known functions to this robot are move(), turn_left(), right_is_clear(), front_is_clear() and wall_in_front(). The challenge here is that the robot maybe placed at any position inside the maze and it is contantly turning around. The code has to address cases were robot is located at the corner of the maze where the location may result in an infinite loop. With the help of a couple of functions and loops, this problem is solved easily. 

Head over to the [maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) and try out this code.

## [*Day 7 - Hangman Game*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%207%20-%20Hangman%20Game/main.py)
Today's code replicates the [Hangman Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). 

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word, you have to guess the letters whithin that word. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

## [*Day 8 - Caesar Cipher*](https://github.com/atena-data/Python-Bootcamp-Codes/blob/main/Day%208%20-%20Caesar%20Cipher/main.py)
